# Introduction

**DevDocs Forge Agent** is a local-first AI documentation agent CLI that converts tutorial transcripts, product demos, and lesson notes into structured developer documentation.

You bring the transcript. DevDocs Forge Agent generates everything else.

## What problem does it solve?

Creating good developer documentation is time-consuming. Most developers have:

* Recorded tutorials or walkthroughs they haven't documented
* Product demos with no written follow-up
* Course lessons or internal training without searchable docs
* Learning notes from talks they attended

DevDocs Forge Agent closes the gap between "video content" and "publishable documentation" — without scraping, without lock-in, and without leaving your terminal.

## What it generates

| Input                      | Output                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Tutorial transcript        | Step-by-step developer guide    |
| Product demo transcript    | Help docs / onboarding page     |
| Course lesson notes        | Lesson page with objectives     |
| Raw learning notes         | Developer blog post             |
| Bug walkthrough            | Troubleshooting guide           |
| API demo                   | README tutorial                 |

## Key principles

### Local-first

DevDocs Forge Agent runs entirely on your machine. No cloud backend, no data processing service, no account required. Your transcripts stay on your machine.

### Bring your own model key

Connect OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini by setting one environment variable. Mock mode works without any API key — useful for development and demos.

### No YouTube scraping

DevDocs Forge Agent does not scrape YouTube, download captions, or access any video platform API for content. You always provide your own transcript file.

### Human review required

Every generation run creates a `review-checklist.md` alongside the generated docs. AI can hallucinate — generated documentation must be reviewed by a human before publishing.

## Who is it for?

* **Developer YouTubers** — turn tutorial recordings into Docusaurus sites
* **DevRel teams** — convert demo recordings into onboarding docs
* **Course creators** — generate lesson pages from lecture notes
* **Open-source maintainers** — create READMEs and troubleshooting guides
* **Technical bloggers** — draft dev.to posts from talk notes
* **SaaS engineering teams** — generate internal runbooks from Loom transcripts
