## Contributions Welcome

Every item marked "Planned" is available to work on. Open an issue to claim it and discuss the approach before building.

Priority contributions (most impactful for the community):
1. Ollama provider — enables fully offline, private use
2. Transcript chunking — handles real-world long transcripts
3. GitHub PR generator — closes the documentation workflow loop
4. VS Code extension — meets developers where they already work
